      <h3>Ethical Dilemma</h3>
      <article>
        Last year, I worked as a Teacher Aide at a high school, working mainly alongside the students that needed the most support (so those with intellectual and physical disabilities, those struggling with behavioural issues, or those suffering from emotional strife). This was a challenging position that presented me with difficult ethical scenarios, daily. 
        <br>
        Several of those students tended to gravitate towards my working area of the school, even during their break times. This was fine by me, though their individual challenges did tend to cause friction between one another. Thus, it naturally became my responsibility to settle the moments of tension as they arose.
      </article>
      <article>
        One student (A) had severe cognitive issues and, for that reason, hadn’t matured as quickly as their fellow students. One day, they were unabashedly swearing loudly, laughing at their audacity – as they seemed to love the thrill of it! I don’t blame them, to be honest; I remember discovering swear words for the first time, too, and the thrill they were to say! In the beginning, I didn’t understand the rules, and I can remember feeling the novelty wear off through repeated experimentation. This is just what A was doing and, as someone that doesn’t find swear words to be inherently offensive, if they weren’t hurting anyone, then power to them. 
        <br>
        Another student, however, B, didn’t share my view; they were deeply offended by the crass nature of A’s language and expected them to be punished for it. 
        <br>
        You can imagine how constantly these delicate ethical situations would arise…  
        <br>
        For one, we were in a school environment, and A’s behaviour is generally not tolerated… so B’s expectation of punishment did have reasonable grounds – and if I were to excuse A’s behaviour, I would be acting against the contract that I was paid to uphold and endorse. Beyond these formal ethical hurdles, B was experiencing genuine emotional strife due to A’s language, and that wasn’t something that I want to perpetuate… 
        <br>
        Then and now, I don’t find myself convinced by the formal, cultural considerations of contract and law as I believe cultural structures ought to reflect the nature of our ethics, and not vice versa. If I were to allow my contractual obligations get in the way of my ethical considerations, I feel that I would be putting the cart before the horse, so-to-speak. 
        <br>
        However, I was swayed by B’s genuine disturbance to A’s behaviour, so I did conclude that *some* authoritarian intervention from me was due… 
        <br>
        The team I worked within found considerable success with sticker charts as a form of reward and punishment for good and bad behaviour, respectively, and for that reason I decided to have a calm, empathetic conversation with A, explaining why the other students, particularly B, were reacting as they were, and asked them to stop their behaviour otherwise I would remove some stickers from their chart. This, I feel, was an appropriate response. 
        <br>
        B disagreed. B wanted A to be sent to detention (as would likely be the result for the majority of the other students). B perceived a severe injustice in my soft treatment of A, which is understandable, presuming that we all ought to play by the same rules. What I believe B was failing to recognise, however, was the unique and extreme circumstances and challenges that A must face, every day. The truth is that we do not exist on a level playing field, and for that reason there is no one-size-fits-all cultural (contractual; legal; moral) structure that is applicable to everyone in equal measure; even the Golden Rule is not as flawless as its name would suggest.
        <br>
        This is the essence of the conversation I had with B, soon after my conversation with A, which was received with mixed emotions. B also deals with their own unique circumstances and extreme challenges, and yet, often does not receive the same flexibility of punishment as A *(again, due to the unique nature of their journey).* I can see why they perceive and experience injustice in my behaviour… but, in reflection, I stand by my decision – for the reasons stated above.

      <h3>My Culture</h3>
      <article>
        From a holistic, economic perspective, I live in a predominantly neoliberal, late-stage capitalist society that inspires meritocratic notions of individualism and cosmopolitanism – empowering individuals to exercise their freedoms, talents and resources to maximise their lives. This environment has, naturally, encouraged me to develop skills that the market deems valuable so I may fulfil both my foundational needs and wildest desires. 
        <br>
        As I’ve grown, I come to the conclusion that our neoliberally structured society – with minimal deliberative practices – does not adequately level the playing field so to promote equity, justice, or peace. Our liberated individualism simply doesn’t have a natural stabilising mechanism and, therefore, the meritocracy we participate within is an illusion. Thus, I am inclined to believe that intrusive, deliberative cultural structures (such as laws, tariffs, reparations, etc.) are justifiable; they ought to be installed to artificially stabilise our society. The million dollar questions are: *by what means* and *to what extent?*
        <br>
        In this life, I’m thankful to have good people around me – as they’re undoubtedly shaping my becoming self. Each one I hold dear possesses strength in their self awareness and their willingness to share the lessons they’ve learned through the mistakes they’ve made. They truly care for and love me, not in spite of my flaws, but because of them; what a wonderful experience this is! They wish for my success and have readily supported me along my journey of self discovery. I’m proud to say they are an ambitious bunch, which has rubbed off on me. My mum says “life isn’t a dress rehearsal; you’ve got to suck the marrow out of it!” – and that’s a sentiment that I’m striving to live by. In that, I aspire to be an unapologetically unconventional character; an optimistic dreamer with courageous intellect and skilful pragmatism. 
        <br>
        I can’t say that I’ve discovered and welcomed this ideal version of my self just yet… but I’m on my way.

      <h3>My Strengths</h3>
      <article>
        In 2014, when I was in Year 12, at age 16, I was introduced to Gallup’s Clifton StrengthsFinder assessment. At that stage of my life, my top five strengths were:
          <h4>2014</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Maximiser</li>
            <li>Relator</li>
            <li>Includer</li>
            <li>Woo</li>
            <li>Analytical</li>
          </ol>
        Six-and-a-half years on, late in 2020 and about to turn 23, I found my original StrengthsFinder results and decided to retake the assessment to see how I’d evolved over that time. My results were:
          <h4>2020</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Maximiser</li>
            <li>Learner</li>
            <li>Responsibility</li>
            <li>Intellection</li>
            <li>Arranger</li>
          </ol>
          I can see myself in each of these results! When I was younger, I was far more extroverted and sociable – comfortably chatting to anybody with ears and loving every second, in a blissful state of ignorance. As I’ve aged, I’ve become more self conscious, for the better and worse. I’m far more thoughtful than ever before, and negotiate several anxieties as a product of that introspection. This, too, stems from my ambition as I strive to become the best person I can be – as I can see all my shortcomings in excruciating detail…
          <br>
          One realisation that has brought me considerable comfort and tremendous agency is that I am simultaneously the victim *and* master of my life, meaning I am both the one that sets the learning curve of my life *and* the one that must climb that slope. In that, if I find myself overwhelmed, I simply level out the learning curve until I have caught my breath and find myself willing to give it another go. Maintaining this balance has become the delicate dance of my life.

        <h3>Resolving Tension</h3>
        <article>
          I’m not sure how relevant this example will turn out to be but, in 2019, I began working for a restaurant in Rotorua. This was the first time that I worked full-time (as opposed to studying at school and university), and thus the first time I was receiving a full-time salary, each week! 
          <br>
          With my first payslip, I bought a brand new pair of Nike Airforce 1 high-tops off’ve the official Nike website – and wore them to work the next day, beaming from ear-to-ear! Everyone was complimenting them, which caught the attention of the Head Chef, so he asked to take a look at ‘em and strolled around the corner, from the kitchen to the bar area… 
          <br>
          I put my right foot out to show him and, before I even had a chance to look up at his reaction, he stamped on my shoe with his greasy boot – leaving a permanent print on mine! 
          <br>
          I was enraged. I called the owners of the establishment, our bosses, for them to step in to rectify the situation; for them to bring justice with their authority by condemning his actions and compelling him to replace the damage goods… but, as Head Chef, he was far more vital to their operation than I was, so they weren’t willing to “die on this hill” as I wanted them to. 
          <br>
          This was a while ago, so I can’t remember what course of action was taken, but I believe I was offered a half-hearted apology and a pat on the back. Needless to say, this didn’t soothe my gripe, though I can understand why the owners were unwilling to side with me: the restaurant was newly established and they were not as invested in the situation as I was; plus, I did somewhat bring the situation upon myself by wearing them into a greasy environment. In that, I suppose this experience did effectively teach me a lot about the real world, and what to expect from it. For the most part, folks are incredibly friendly and cooperative, but I will encounter folks that don’t have my best interests in mind and, since the world doesn’t revolve around me, I ought to proactively mitigate these sorts of situations from arising.
