          <h3>Things I Have Learned</h3>
          <p>
            For much of my life, I have been fixated on being likeable and, in
            doing so, have not become a very assertive presence in this world.
            Throughout Foundations, however, I have felt myself becoming more
            vocal and proactive. I feel less rigid; less likely to second-guess
            my opinions, and therefore more willing to go with the flow and
            speak my mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have been living alone throughout Foundations, too, which I
            believe must've had an impact on my changing behaviour. Quite
            simply, I have loved the peace and quiet that this lifestyle affords
            me; I consider it the greatest luxury I've ever enjoyed. I used to
            live in Queenstown and, before that, in Wellington – with flatmates
            that I still consider friends – and I can say with absolute
            certainty that I would not be finding the same level of success in
            this program if I were still living in either of those
            circumstances.
          </p>
          <p>
            Living alone, there's nobody to hold me accountable but myself. In
            this, I've learned that I will never feel completely ready to begin
            working; to immerse myself in the unknown. There will always be a
            part of me that wants to cut myself some more slack, instead of
            pulling the weight. Through this truth, I'm learning to arrive to
            work with all of myself <em>including</em> the parts of myself that
            are apprehensive. That way, when the "better" part of me succeeds,
            the "worse" part of me can enjoy that success, too. In other words,
            my success won't be in spite of my "worse" tendencies but, rather,
            coexists with those tendencies.
          </p>
          <h3>Values, Reason, Self-Awareness and Empathy</h3>
          <p>
            Learning anything (but particularly programming) is both challenging
            and confronting. By near-definition, they lead the learner to feel
            inadequate (at least to begin with) – which is an inherently
            stressful situation to put one's self into.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this environment, values bring meaning and direction to the
            otherwise-senseless stress. For example, if one values basic
            resources and security, as we all do, then the stressful suffering
            incurred within a learning environment can be understood as a
            necessary burden for progression toward a life with plenty of
            resources and security.
          </p>
          <p>
            In fact, Viktor Frankl would argue that the stress ceases to be
            sufferable. In Man's Search for Meaning, Frankl quotes Friedrich
            Nietzsche, who said
            <em>"he who has a why to live can bear almost any how."</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            The quote above speaks to the important of having a reason, which
            wraps the discourse back around to rationality. Programming is a
            hyper-rational realm of thought and productivity, and thus any
            immersion into the realm ought to be reasonable and purposeful.
          </p>
          <aside>
            The question thus becomes:
            <em>why am I putting myself through this?</em>
          </aside>
          <p>
            Pragmatically, I'm here for the reasons listed above: I need
            resources to survive and would like to secure those means for
            existence; but, furthermore, I want to make a contribution to this
            world; to restore it, somehow – and to do this I must grow my
            skillset. It is this meaningful, valuable, and reasonable quest of
            mine that will bring me resilience and drive as I am faced with
            challenge, going forward.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similarly, valuing the likes of honesty, humility and integrity will
            ground the learning journey upon a foundation of truth, which is
            also the foundation of reason. By holding these virtues, I will
            enjoy a smoother learning curve as I engage myself with appropriate
            challenges at appropriate times. This point echoes Aesop's fable of
            the Tortoise and the Hare: <em>slow and steady wins the race;</em> I
            will not bite off more than I can chew.
          </p>
          <p>
            To have empathy is to recognise that all of life is on a similar
            pathway to yours, but never the same path. In some respects, you may
            be ahead of them, and in others, they may be ahead of you; but that
            is ultimately subjective...
          </p>
          <p>
            Empathy breeds compassion and humility, each of which bolster one's
            ability to connect and coexist with other subjective minds. It also
            endorses one's agency, encouraging a sense of mutual responsibility
            to one-another. I like to believe that I am not more-or-less worthy
            for being the person that I am, and that all life is inherently
            innocent. By extension, I believe that nobody is beyond
            rehabilitation and that anybody can grow through their current state
            of mind. We are products of our environment, and this too shall
            pass.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within the context of programming, I ought not to feel clever or
            defeated depending on the current situation I'm in. Instead, I
            should feel both emotions simultaneously; both the genius and the
            fool. This coinhabitance of emotionality should be extended to the
            people I meet along my learning journey, regardless of how they
            present themselves to me. Everybody can make mistakes, and I should
            warmly laugh at my own whenever I make one.
          </p>
          <h3>Surpising Aspects of the Core Learnings</h3>
          <p>
            I don't think I've conceptually learned anything new throughout the
            core learning aspects of Foundations, but I have enjoyed putting
            them into practice.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is particularly true for the introductory phase of Foundations.
            I am especially proud of the vulnerability I shared and the
            resonating impact it seemed to have on the other contributions that
            followed my own. In that, I suppose I am surprised at how quickly I
            have felt a genuine connection and camaraderie with my peers within
            my cohort, and this connection is largely due to the prompts
            throughout the core learning aspects of Foundations.
          </p>
          <p>
            The greatest opportunities to develop connections with my peers have
            been the Listening and Looping sessions, from the second half of
            Foundations. These have been very challenging for me, as I have an
            ADHD diagnosis and thus anxiety is an ever-present part of my life.
            Additionally, I'd consider myself a socially ambitious person;
            perhaps, self-aware to a destructive degree, so I take both
            responsibilities of listening and looping very seriously – and with
            that comes anxiety.
          </p>
          <p>
            Suffice to say, when my conversational parter pours themselves into
            their words, I want to reflect their sentiments back to them as
            accurately as I can. I feel that the world is an incredibly lonely;
            sadly superficial place, largely due to our limited capcity to hold
            space for others and our ineloquence when trying to express our
            impressions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The underlying belief is that brings me anxiety is: to the extent
            that I am unable to properly distill and then reflect my partner's
            sentiments, I will re-demonstrate their isolation inherent to the
            human experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            And yet, despite those beliefs, I thoroughly enjoyed the Listening
            and Looping practice sessions prompted by the core learning
            component of Foundations. As daunting as it is to truly listen to
            someone, it is an absolute honour to do so and I am proud of the
            attempt I gave in each session. It is a skill that I would like tp practice
            much more, and so would encourage Dev Academy to place a greater emphasis on 
            this, going forward!
          </p>
          <h3>Why the Focus on Core Learning?</h3>
          <p>
            It makes sense as to why Dev Academy places so much focus on their
            student's internal core, alongside their technical skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            Programming is such a pure form of communication so, when a difficulty
            is encountered, it is very easy for individuals to become hard on
            their selves for finding such difficulty. It is important
            to have self-awareness and empathy toward other selves in this industry
            because we are not hyper-rational beings; we are human and
            inherently fallible. In a nutshell, programming has such a steep learning
            curve that this journey can often feel like running up against
            a brick wall. To progress, programmers ought to smooth out the
            learning curve, which is only achieved through the likes of humility, integrity and self-awareness.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, Dev Academy offers NZQA credits for completing this
            course, and NZQA surely has requirements that ground the technical
            lessons within our culture and society. By offering the core
            learning component alongside the technical component, Dev Academy
            brings a more robust product to market. The NZQA credits is what
            allows this course to be eligible for StudyLink's student loan
            program, which is the only reason I have been able to afford to
            participate in this program, and I am sure that I'm not alone in
            this. So the core component of the program widens the scope of the
            market that they are catering to. Essentially, it's good business to
            offer a core component.
          </p>
          <h3>Does the Time Spent on Core Feel Wasted?</h3>
          <p>
            For me, personally, core has felt like a great waste of time, as I
            believe I already have considerable self-awareness. I have not
            learned anything new from the core learning program, thus far, and
            to be honest, I don't expect to, going forward. From some discussion
            on the Discord server, it seems that I am not alone in this, either;
            the cohort seems to be generally quite self-aware and knowledgable
            about the terminology introduced throughout the Foundational core
            component. In this, the core lessons felt somewhat trivial and,
            perhaps, tokenistic – as if Dev Academy was simply checking a box to
            satisfy NZQA's requirements for funding and accreditation, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            I guess the sentiment I'm hoping to convey here is "if you're going
            to do something, do it well" – and I'm not sure that the core
            lessons would be all that relevant to anybody who has done a bit of
            reading on the topic before – which should be most of the course
            participants, as they're a cohort of people that have signed up for
            a coding course, so you might expect that these are people that already
            believe they have the ability to grow their expertise...
          </p>
          <p>
            In saying that, I'm very glad that we have had the opportunity to
            put the core lessons into practice, as I don't believe there is such
            a thing as too much practice in this realm of thought. I'm really
            glad that the practical focus on core learnings has been established
            so emphatically. I feel that everybody is willing to have meaningful
            conversations about their core, and that will undoubtedly pay
            dividends, going forward. Just as the technical foundational
            learnings were designed to get everybody on the same page, the
            practical, foundational core learnings have surely done the same for
            our spirits, heading into Bootcamp.
