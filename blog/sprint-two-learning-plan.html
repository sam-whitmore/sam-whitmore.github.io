        <h3>The Vision</h3>
        <p>
          Since leaving high school, in 2015, I have spent my life searching for
          a career pathway that I find fulfilling.
        </p>
        <p>In my experience, I am fulfilled whenever:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I am engaged in a challenge that I ultimately find rewarding.</li>
          <li>I am excited to wake up in the morning; well rested.</li>
          <li>I feel progressive momentum throughout my life.</li>
          <li>I share my enthusiasm with my peers, family, and friends.</li>
          <li>I seamlessly incorporate regular exercise into my life.</li>
          <li>I have time available at the end of each day, for relaxation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I am excited to become a developer because I feel that it will
          liberate me; I am striving toward a work-life balance such that I may
          choose when, where, why, and how I work. I like the idea of travelling
          the world whilst contributing to meaningful projects, and I enjoy
          possessing a skill that is incredibly valuable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Initially, I would like to earn a living by working for a company that
          is integrated within the software industry. I would like to learn from
          this experience, to then apply that experience towards my own
          projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have three ideas for social networking applications, one idea for a
          clothing company and another idea for a SaaS company, one idea for a
          charity, and one idea for a video game. I am completely proud of each
          of these ideas, and I feel encouraged to pursue these ventures. If
          you're curious, I'd be happy to tell you more another time!
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, the vision is to create fantastic, progressive tools that
          liberate people – empowering them to enjoy their lives – and to
          achieve those goals while enjoying my own life.
        </p>

        <h3>The Road Ahead</h3>
        <p>
          I believe I am currently in a position to achieve the goals that I
          have laid out, above.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whilst completing this Dev Academy course, I am living alone in
          Tauranga with nobody depending on me – so I am able to completely
          focus on the task at hand. I have also recently had a significant
          upgrade of my glasses and I am back on my ADHD medication (after a
          brief stint without them), so I am generally feeling more healthy,
          energetic, focused, and capable than ever before.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, I live very close by to the local swimming facility,
          Baywave, at which I regularly swim lengths and rest in the sauna. This
          practice has been doing wonders for my physical health, which I
          understand is particularly important for software developers to
          maintain (as they spend so much time sitting down, in front of
          computers); and furthermore, I am receiving the student living
          allowance through StudyLink which is enabling this lifestyle.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          With that scene now set, it seems that there are very few cultural or
          societal, objective obstacles in my way; therefore, I am currently
          operating under the view that the primary limiting factors in this
          equation will stem from my subjective experience. Specifically, it is
          my character that will define the degree of my success in this course.
        </p>
        <p>
          I recently had an incredible conversation with a friend of mine in
          which he called me out for being too ethereal and nonpragmatic.
          Essentially, he argued that I'm too much of a philosopher on the
          side-line of life as opposed to a player in the game. I say the
          conversation was incredible because I have found myself convinced by
          his stance: my philosophising has been the source of my anxiety and
          inaction; not to say that philosophy should be avoided, but it should
          also not be a committed way of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a result, I am now fostering a greater sense of discipline through
          conviction. I have poured years of self-analysis into myself and it is
          now time for me to leap into it, thereby immersing and integrating
          myself into my world. This is the road ahead, anyway, and it is easier
          said than done.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, I will be limited by my unwillingness to do the work. I
          know I can talk-the-talk, but it's now time to walk-the-walk.
        </p>

        <h3>The Skills I'll Develop</h3>
        <p>
          I like that Dev Academy distinguishes between the technical side of
          programming and the human experience that underlies it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Technically, I would like to become a competent full-stack developer.
          I would like to understand state-management and data-management;
          essentially, back-end development, as I believe this is the true
          foundational knowledge that will accelerate me towards achieving my
          goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          I want to learn how to develop applications that are accessible across
          multiple hardwares so the tools I create will be engaged with
          uninanimously, across cultural sub-cultures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Encompassing both the hard; technical and the soft; subjective realms
          of this course, I essentially want to become self-sufficient. I want
          to become the author of my destiny by developing myself such that I
          can open any door that I dare to – and I believe I'm on my way.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h3>The Workload</h3>
        <p>
          As mentioned above, I am in an incredibly fortunate position in life,
          supported by those around me and personally hungry for success. I plan
          to thrive in this course.
        </p>
        <p>
          One practice I've been getting into recently, ever since joining the
          Dev Academy discord server, is routinely joining the voice-chat
          Co-working Spaces whilst I'm getting on with the programme. This has
          been successful for three reasons:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            It has kept me honestly focused on the work, despite living alone;
          </li>
          <li>
            It has offered me regular social interaction with my peers; and
          </li>
          <li>I have begun teaching my peers when they get stuck.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          I'm going to keep up this practice, whenever possible. The only times
          it may not be beneficial is when the conversation becomes distracting
          instead of enabling and encouraging. I will stay vigilant of this
          trap.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, thus far, I do not feel intimated by the course
          material, but I can surely understand why somebody that isn't in my
          position would begin to feel overwhelmed by it. I do not intend to
          flaunt my confidence as I can envision that being distressing for
          those that are beginning to feel unconfident. In that, humility is the
          name of the game; humility and diligence.

        <h3>Seeking Support</h3>
        <p>
          I have sought support through the Discord a number of times now, and
          every response has been fantastic. I have been proud of myself for
          reaching out, I believe, at an appropriate time and after considerable
          attempts to self-correct my mistakes. I believe my positive
          experiences when seeking support through the discord is a testament to
          the detail that I have included in my requests for assistance, clearly
          showing my train of thought and the mystery before me. I will strive
          to continue this behaviour, going forward.
        </p>
      </article>
      <h3>The Facilitation Team</h3>
      <p>
        I do not have much to say about the Facilitation Team, at this stage, as
        I have not shared a considerable amount of time with them. I am excited
        for the proper bootcamp to begin, where I imagine their presence in my
        learning journey will be more apparent.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope for them to be inspiring mentors along my learning journey,
        presenting exciting kernels of knowledge and sharing a zest for the
        industry. I hope they see the best in me, better than I can see for
        myself, and help me to share their perspective of my road ahead.
      </p>
      <article>
        <h3>Clashing Commitments</h3>
        <p>
          As mentioned above, I am fortunate to have very few dependencies or
          distractions in my life, so I do not expect to need a rigorous
          regiment to structure my learning. Provided I stay the course, I
          expect to comfortably stay afloat throughout.

        <h3>My Long-term Goal</h3>
        <p>
          I have multiple projects that I would like to produce: Fabric, MixMap,
          and Coordinary being the three ideas I am most passionate about.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope to become a competent full-stack developer, with an advanced
          understanding of the current (and thereby future) state of the
          software development industry. I aspire to become self-sufficient,
          financially secure, and capable of working independently anywhere in
          the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Fabric, in particular, I need to learn how to configure and
          maintain a large database that is consistently being requested by
          Fabric's userbase. I need to learn how to facilitate account creation,
          and I need to create multiple, different user experiences depending on
          account type. Fabric is completely data dependent, so I will need to
          learn how to share data between users, and how to configure privacy
          settings such that individual users will be in control of how much
          data is shared with other accounts. Speaking of which, I would like to
          learn about the policies that surround the sharing of data.
          Furthermore, I want to display the collected data in various ways (on
          charts and maps), so I will need to learn how to do this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regarding MixMap, I believe I need to learn how to create a neural
          network...
        </p>
        <p>
          MixMap is an application for DJs to create and share their setlists.
          They'll achieve this by selecting from the pool of available songs
          (each with their own subdata and metadata), and threading them
          together. The idea is that their MixMap will visualise their otherwise
          mental map of the music they like to play, and amateur DJs will be
          able to explore their favourite artist's MixMaps. Additionally,
          whenever a new song is released, a new node in the network will be
          created and fans of the song will flock to thread it into the network;
          I imagine users will earn badges for threading songs together first,
          etc., and all this activity will demonstrate the success of the song.
          There's a bunch of skills that I will need to learn to get this off
          the ground, though I expect that this will be a project that I take on
          after Bootcamp has finished.
        </p>
        <p>
          Coordinary is a not-for-profit web infrastructure that allows shelters
          for the houseless (and really any charity) to create wishlists that
          they can then advertise through their own media channels. You know how
          brides and grooms will create a gift registry for their wedding so
          they don't receive the same gift six times? Coordinary is a gift
          registry for the houseless. I can see that many of the skills we
          should learn throughout Bootcamp will translate to this project, well.
          I suppose, to be specific, that I will need to learn how to handle
          payments through an e-commerce website (through Stripe, I presume),
          and generally how to create an e-commerce store. I think each charity
          should have its own, customisable page, and charities should have to
          be validated, somehow. These are all questions for further down the
          track!
        </p>
        <p>
          For now, I am focused on Fabric – through which I hope to improve my
          user's emotional integrity on both the intrapersonal and interpersonal
          level.
        </p>
        <h3>My Strengths & Weaknesses</h3>
        <p>
          Reading back my prior blog post, I'm generally proud of how I come across (though a bit pretentious, perhaps).
          As I said, I am currently fortunate enough to have very few cultural limitations before me, so my success in this program will be largely dictated by my willingness to put my head down and do the work. So long as I sustain a disciplined approach to the work load, and keep myself honest (as no one else will be around to keep me honest), I expect myself to thrive in this course. 
          I reckon the fact that I have so many ideas that I want to pursue is a great strength for me, within this context. 
        </p>
        <h3>Non-technical Challenges</h3>
        <p>
          I reckon the thing I will find most difficult is the maintenance of my physical well-being throughout the coming months. I do not have a car, so must walk to the gym and supermarket, and I do not have a clothes dryer; so my livelihood is very dependent on the weather. If we have a harsh winter, then I might struggle to lead a balanced lifestyle. 
        </p>
        <h3>Human Skills to Develop</h3>
        <p>
          I believe I have a decent 'human skillset;' a product of my self-awareness. In fact, I believe I am too self-aware; too self-conscious for my own good. I reckon I should mitigate my anxiety by second-guessing myself less and going with the flow more; trusting that my current self is a good one. 
        </p>
        <h3>My Expectations of the Bootcamp Team</h3>
        <p>
          I expect to be challenged appropriately, and to develop skills that will stand the test of time. I expect the lessons I learn, especially in the later weeks of Bootcamp, to be tailored towards my interests and goals, and I expect the facilitators to be forthcoming with their enthusiam and expertise regarding my projects (particularly Fabric). I would like for them to recognise my legitimate desire to understand this industry, and for them to answer my questions accordingly. 
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end of the Bootcamp, I will be seeking employment in the industry, and I expect some support from Dev Academy throughout this process. 
        </p>
        <h3>My Expectations of Myself</h3>
        <p>
          I go through waves of enthusiasm for each of my projects, and I would like to see them through. I surely do not expect to have them all completed by the end of Bootcamp, but I do expect myself to listen intently – not only to the lessons that are pertinent to my current projects, but also to the lessons that may be pertinent to some future, currently unknown project, too... so, really, I expect myself to listen intently. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I also expect myself to be proactive in all aspects of my life, to maintain the balance of my lifestyle as best as I can. In particular, I should feed and sleep myself appropriately so I arrive to work each day single-minded. This will be beneficial not only to me, but also my peers in this course. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, I hope to maintain and nurture a sense of playfulness throughout this course. I know that I learn best when I am in a state of play; a state of flow – so I hope to encourage that.
