      <h3>The Vision</h3>
      <p>
        Since leaving high school, in 2015, I have spent my life searching for a career pathway that I find fulfilling.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my experience, I am fulfilled whenever:
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>I am engaged in a challenge that I ultimately find rewarding.</li>
          <li>I am excited to wake up in the morning; well rested.</li>
          <li>I feel progressive momentum throughout my life.</li>
          <li>I share my enthusiasm with my peers, family, and friends.</li>
          <li>I seamlessly incorporate regular exercise into my life.</li>
          <li>I have time available at the end of each day, for relaxation.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        I am excited to become a developer because I feel that it will liberate me; I am striving toward a work-life balance such that I may choose when, where, why, and how I work. I like the idea of travelling the world whilst contributing to meaningful projects, and I enjoy possessing a skill that is incredibly valuable. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Initially, I would like to earn a living by working for a company that is integrated within the software industry. I would like to learn from this experience, to then apply that experience towards my own projects. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I have three ideas for social networking applications, one idea for a clothing company and another idea for a SaaS company, one idea for a charity, and one idea for a video game. I am completely proud of each of these ideas, and I feel encouraged to pursue these ventures. If you're curious, I'd be happy to tell you more another time!
      </p>
      <p>In summary, the vision is to create fantastic, progressive tools that liberate people – empowering them to enjoy their lives – and to achieve those goals while enjoying my own life.</p>

      <h3>The Road Ahead</h3>
      <p>
        I believe I am currently in a position to achieve the goals that I have laid out, above.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whilst completing this Dev Academy course, I am living alone in Tauranga with nobody depending on me – so I am able to completely focus on the task at hand. I have also recently had a significant upgrade of my glasses and I am back on my ADHD medication (after a brief stint without them), so I am generally feeling more healthy, energetic, focused, and capable than ever before.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, I live very close by to the local swimming facility, Baywave, at which I regularly swim lengths and rest in the sauna. This practice has been doing wonders for my physical health, which I understand is particularly important for software developers to maintain (as they spend so much time sitting down, in front of computers); and furthermore, I am receiving the student living allowance through StudyLink which is enabling this lifestyle. 
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p>
        With that scene now set, it seems that there are very few cultural or societal, objective obstacles in my way; therefore, I am currently operating under the view that the primary limiting factors in this equation will stem from my subjective experience. Specifically, it is my character that will define the degree of my success in this course.
      </p>
      <p>
        I recently had an incredible conversation with a friend of mine in which he called me out for being too ethereal and nonpragmatic. Essentially, he argued that I'm too much of aphilosopher on the side-line of life as opposed to a player in the game. I say the conversation was incredible because I have found myself convinced by his stance: my philosophising has been the source of my anxiety and inaction; not to say that philosophy should be avoided, but it should also not be a committed way of life. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result, I am now fostering a greater sense of discipline through conviction. I have poured years of self-analysis into myself and it is now time for me to leap into it, thereby immersing and integrating myself into my world. This is the road ahead, anyway, and it is easier said than done.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately, I will be limited by my unwillingness to do the work. I know I can talk-the-talk, but it's now time to walk-the-walk.

      <h3>The Skills I'll Develop</h3>
      <p>
        I like that Dev Academy distinguishes between the technical side of programming and the human experience that underlies it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Technically, I would like to become a competent full-stack developer. I would like to understand state-management and data-management; essentially, back-end development, as I believe this is the true foundational knowledge that will accelerate me towards achieving my goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to learn how to develop applications that are accessible across multiple hardwares so the tools I create will be engaged with uninanimously, across cultural sub-cultures. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Encompassing both the hard; technical and the soft; subjective realms of this course, I essentially want to become self-sufficient. I want to become the author of my destiny by developing myself such that I can open any door that I dare to – and I believe I'm on my way.
      </p>

      <h3>The Workload</h3>
      <p>
        As mentioned above, I am in an incredibly fortunate position in life, supported by those around me and personally hungry for success. I plan to thrive in this course.  
      </p>
      <p> 
        One practice I've been getting into recently, ever since joining the Dev Academy discord server, is routinely joining the voice-chat Co-working Spaces whilst I'm getting on with the programme. This has been successful for three reasons: 
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>It has kept me honestly focused on the work, despite living alone;</li> 
        <li>It has offered me regular social interaction with my peers; and</li>
        <li>I have begun teaching my peers when they get stuck.</li>  
      </ol>
      <p>
        I'm going to keep up this practice, whenever possible. The only times it may not be beneficial is when the conversation becomes distracting instead of enabling and encouraging. I will stay vigilant of this trap.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, thus far, I do not feel intimated by the course material, but I can surely understand why somebody that isn't in my position would begin to feel overwhelmed by it. I do not intend to flaunt my confidence as I can envision that being distressing for those that are beginning to feel unconfident. In that, humility is the name of the game; humility and diligence.
      </p>

      <h3>Seeking Support</h3>
      <p>
        I have sought support through the Discord a number of times now, and every response has been fantastic. I have been proud of myself for reaching out, I believe, at an appropriate time and after considerable attempts to self-correct my mistakes. I believe my positive experiences when seeking support through the discord is a testament to the detail that I have included in my requests for assistance, clearly showing my train of thought and the mystery before me. I will strive to continue this behaviour, going forward. 
      </p>

      <h3>The Facilitation Team</h3>
      <p>
        I do not have much to say about the Facilitation Team, at this stage, as I have not shared a considerable amount of time with them. I am excited for the proper bootcamp to begin, where I imagine their presence in my learning journey will be more apparent. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope for them to be inspiring mentors along my learning journey, presenting exciting kernels of knowledge and sharing a zest for the industry. I hope they see the best in me, better than I can see for myself, and help me to share their perspective of my road ahead. 
      </p>
    <article>
      <h3>Clashing Commitments</h3>
      <p>
        As mentioned above, I am fortunate to have very few dependencies or distractions in my life, so I do not expect to need a rigorous regiment to structure my learning. Provided I stay the course, I expect to comfortably stay afloat throughout.
