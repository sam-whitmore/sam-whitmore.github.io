        <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
        <article>
          <p>
            Emotional intelligence is the ability to observe, recognise, and navigate both one's own internal, subjective experience and the subjective experiences of those around us. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Often referred to as EQ (an acronym of Emotional Quotient), it is the counterpart to IQ (Intelligence Quotient) which describes our capacity to observe, recognise, and navigate our external, objective realm. Combined, they form the basis of our intellectual domain.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though splitting this domain into such a simple dichotomy is imprecise, it is a highly efficient line to draw, generally separating the "hard skills" such as rationalisation and calculation from the "soft skills" such as relationship cultivation and conflict resolution. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Both forms of intelligence are important for a successful; balanced life.

          <h3>Why is EQ important?</h3>
          <p>
            Emotional intelligence is important because it empowers individuals to smoothly navigate through the subjective realm. "Soft skills" include "reading the room," holding space when listening to another person speak their mind, collaborating with peers, "agreeing to disagree" when necessary and, ultimately, forgiving both one's self and others, when appropriate.
          </p>
          <p>
            A book I love, called The Serendipity Mindset, argues that it is not enough to be lucky in life – as an individual must be present, willing, and able to receive the gifts of their luck that life offers them. One must behave with integrity – that is, become <u>integr</u>ated with both the objective <em>and</em> subjective realms they find themselves within – in order to realise their potential; and integrating one's self with one's community is arguably the greatest of life's gifts. 
          </p>
          <p>This, I believe, is the importance of emotional intelligence. </p>
