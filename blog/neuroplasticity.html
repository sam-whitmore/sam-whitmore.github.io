          <h3>Neuroplasticity and Dev Academy</h3>
          <p>
            The adult brain is not entirely hard-wired, as it was once thought to be. The adult brain can adaptively reorganise its neural networks in response to intrinsic and extrinsic stimuli. Quite simply, this capacity – formally called neuroplasticity – is how humans change their minds. 
          </p>
          <p>
            According to <a class="inline-link" href="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Principles_of_Neuroplasticity">Physiopedia</a>, specificity, intensity, timing, repetition and consistency are the main pillars of any experience that drives neurological evolution.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within the context of Dev Academy, a context in which I am working to adapt to new challenges and gain new skills, an understanding of neuroplasticity will shape my approach to the challenges before me; I will become more willing to trust the process. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Following Physiopedia’s guidelines, I will harness my neuroplasticity by approaching my learning journey with focus and intention – single-mindedly tackling each challenge meaningfully, with minimal distractions around me. 
          </p>
          <p>
            This approach speaks to the intensity pillar, too, as the full immersion this approach encourages is inherently all-encompassing. This pillar does not intend to overwhelm, however; the website cited above states that one must “carefully match the dynamic and changing needs…, balancing the need for rest with activity.” This is the true notion of all-encompassing, speaking to the repetition and consistency pillars. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Neurological pathways only exist to the extent that they are available for use. This fact leads to the common saying: “use it or lose it.” Perhaps unfortunately, the other side of the neuroplasticity coin is that there is no end to one’s learning journey because the human brain is never fixed. This means one can never consider knowledge to be fully and finally learned (past tense); it is a continuous process, maintaining one’s knowledge and skillsets. 
          </p>
          <h3>Growth Mindsets and Resets</h3>
          <p>
            The term mindset brings forth notions of a set mind but, as detailed above, our minds are largely plastic. “Growth mindset,” thus understood, is somewhat paradoxical, as minds are never "set," so-to-speak.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mental growth may be better understood as a mind reset or, at the very least, an understanding that our mind is capable of desetting and resetting one’s self. Recognising one’s self as both a constructive and destructive practice rattles dogmatic trains of thought that are inherently deliberative. In similar words, we liberate (destruct) ourselves so we may deliberate (construct ourselves) in new forms.
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoyed <a class="inline-link" href="https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve#t-459099">Carol Dweck’s TED Talk</a> where she discusses the power of the word “yet” because the term invokes notions of the continuous learning journey and, by extension, the plasticity of one’s mind. Given a situation where one has tried and “failed” to solve a puzzle: it’s not that this person is not smart enough to overcome the challenge; rather, they have simply not solved it yet. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I am reminded of a philosophical riddle by Nelson Goodman: 
          </p>
          <aside>
            Suppose that your research is in gemology. Your special interest lies in the colour properties of certain gemstones, in particular, emeralds. All emeralds you have examined before a certain time t were green, so your notebook is full of evidence statements of the form: “Emerald x; found at place y, date z ( z≤t ); colour is green”. 
          </aside>
          <br>
          <aside>
            It seems that, at this time t, the hypothesis that “all emeralds are green” ought to be confirmed as true.
          </aside>
          <p>
            Now, Goodman introduces the predicate called grue: a colour profile that shifts over time, initially green, but after some time t, blue.
          </p>
          <aside>
            The riddle, of sorts, follows; it is impossible to definitively state “all emeralds are green” because it is entirely possible that some emeralds are grue and we simply exist before t when the emeralds’ colour shifts from green to blue. 
          </aside>
          <p>
            For both Carol Dweck and Nelson Goodman, the lesson they share is to maintain an attitude that is willing and able to be proven wrong. 
          </p>
          <h3>Neuroplasticity and My Learning Journey</h3>
          <p>
            In reflection, I should not approach my coding journey as if it is finite, with a beginning, middle, and end. Growth is an infinite game, whereby one doesn’t play to win; rather, one plays to stay in the game. Growth isn’t a matter of keeping score and comparing one’s score to another players; it’s a matter of maintaining the necessary resources to sustain playfulness. 
          </p>
          <p>
            With the freedom I possess to choose what game I play, I ought to be careful with that choice such that I find it meaningful and fulfilling. Specificity, in this sense, is matched with its converse: holism. My attitude will thereby encourage a balanced level of intensity, timing and repetition that sustains my willingness and ability to both practice and play.
