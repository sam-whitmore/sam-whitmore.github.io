      <h3>Ethical Dilemma</h3>
      <article>
        <p>
        Last year, I worked as a Teacher Aide at a high school, working mainly
        alongside the students that needed the most support (so those with
        intellectual and physical disabilities, those struggling with
        behavioural issues, or those suffering from emotional strife). This was
        a challenging position that presented me with difficult ethical
        scenarios, daily.
        </p>
        <p>
        Several of those students tended to gravitate towards my working area of
        the school, even during their break times. This was fine by me, though
        their individual challenges did tend to cause friction between one
        another. Thus, it naturally became my responsibility to settle the
        moments of tension as they arose.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <p>
        One student (A) had severe cognitive issues and, for that reason, hadn’t
        matured as quickly as their fellow students. One day, they were
        unabashedly swearing loudly, laughing at their audacity – as they seemed
        to love the thrill of it! I don’t blame them, to be honest; I remember
        discovering swear words for the first time, too, and the thrill they
        were to say! In the beginning, I didn’t understand the rules, and I can
        remember feeling the novelty wear off through repeated experimentation.
        This is just what A was doing and, as someone that doesn’t find swear
        words to be inherently offensive, if they weren’t hurting anyone, then
        power to them.
        </p>
        <p>
        Another student, however, B, didn’t share my view; they were deeply
        offended by the crass nature of A’s language and expected them to be
        punished for it.
        </p>
        <aside>
        <em style="font-size: 16px">You can imagine how constantly these delicate ethical situations would
        arise…</em>
        </aside>
        <p>
        For one, we were in a school environment, and A’s behaviour is generally
        not tolerated… so B’s expectation of punishment did have reasonable
        grounds – and if I were to excuse A’s behaviour, I would be acting
        against the contract that I was paid to uphold and endorse. Beyond these
        formal ethical hurdles, B was experiencing genuine emotional strife due
        to A’s language, and that wasn’t something that I want to perpetuate…
        </p>
        <p>
        Then and now, I don’t find myself convinced by the formal, cultural
        considerations of contract and law as I believe cultural structures
        ought to reflect the nature of our ethics, and not vice versa. If I were
        to allow my contractual obligations get in the way of my ethical
        considerations, I feel that I would be putting the cart before the
        horse, so-to-speak.
        </p>
        <p>
        However, I was swayed by B’s genuine disturbance to A’s behaviour, so I
        did conclude that <em>some</em> authoritarian intervention from me was due…
        </p>
        <p>
        The team I worked within found considerable success with sticker charts
        as a form of reward and punishment for good and bad behaviour,
        respectively, and for that reason I decided to have a calm, empathetic
        conversation with A, explaining why the other students, particularly B,
        were reacting as they were, and asked them to stop their behaviour
        otherwise I would remove some stickers from their chart. This, I feel,
        was an appropriate response.
        </p>
        <p>
        B disagreed. B wanted A to be sent to detention (as would likely be the
        result for the majority of the other students). B perceived a severe
        injustice in my soft treatment of A, which is understandable, presuming
        that we all ought to play by the same rules. What I believe B was
        failing to recognise, however, was the unique and extreme circumstances
        and challenges that A must face, every day. The truth is that we do not
        exist on a level playing field, and for that reason there is no
        one-size-fits-all cultural (contractual; legal; moral) structure that is
        applicable to everyone in equal measure; even the Golden Rule is not as
        flawless as its name would suggest.
        </p>
        <p>
        This is the essence of the conversation I had with B, soon after my
        conversation with A, which was received with mixed emotions. B also
        deals with their own unique circumstances and extreme challenges, and
        yet, often does not receive the same flexibility of punishment as A
        <em>(again, due to the unique nature of their journey).</em> I can see why they
        perceived my behaviour to be unjust… but, in reflection, I
        stand by my decision – for the reasons stated above.
        </p>

      <h3>My Culture</h3>
      <article>
        <p>From a holistic, economic perspective, I live in a predominantly
        neoliberal, late-stage capitalist society that inspires meritocratic
        notions of individualism and cosmopolitanism – empowering individuals to
        exercise their freedoms, talents and resources to maximise their lives.
        This environment has, naturally, encouraged me to develop skills that
        the market deems valuable so I may fulfil both my foundational needs and
        wildest desires.</p>
        <p>As I’ve grown, I come to the conclusion that our neoliberally structured
        society – with minimal deliberative practices – does not adequately
        level the playing field so to promote equity, justice, or peace. Our
        liberated individualism simply doesn’t have a natural stabilising
        mechanism and, therefore, the meritocracy we participate within is an
        illusion. Thus, I am inclined to believe that intrusive, deliberative
        cultural structures (such as laws, tariffs, reparations, etc.) are
        justifiable; they ought to be installed to artificially stabilise our
        society. The million dollar questions are: <em>by what means</em> and <em>to what
        extent?</em></p>
        
        <p>In this life, I’m thankful to have good people around me – as they’re
        undoubtedly shaping my becoming self. Each one I hold dear possesses
        strength in their self awareness and their willingness to share the
        lessons they’ve learned through the mistakes they’ve made. They truly
        care for and love me, not in spite of my flaws, but because of them;
        what a wonderful experience this is! They wish for my success and have
        readily supported me along my journey of self discovery. I’m proud to
        say they are an ambitious bunch, which has rubbed off on me. My mum says
        “life isn’t a dress rehearsal; you’ve got to suck the marrow out of it!”
        – and that’s a sentiment that I’m striving to live by. In that, I aspire
        to be an unapologetically unconventional character; an optimistic
        dreamer with courageous intellect and skilful pragmatism.</p>
        <p>I can’t say that I’ve discovered and welcomed this ideal version of my
        self just yet… but I’m on my way.</p>

      <h3>My Strengths</h3>
      <article>
        <p>In 2014, when I was in Year 12, age 16, I was introduced to <a href="https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/253715/34-cliftonstrengths-themes.aspx">Gallup’s
        CliftonStrengths</a> assessment. At that stage of my life, my top
        five strengths were:</p>
        <h4>2014</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Maximiser</li>
          <li>Relator</li>
          <li>Includer</li>
          <li>Woo</li>
          <li>Analytical</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Six-and-a-half years on, late in 2020 and about to turn 23, I found my
        original results and decided to retake the assessment to
        see how I’d evolved over that time. My results were:</p>
        <h4>2020</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Maximiser</li>
          <li>Learner</li>
          <li>Responsibility</li>
          <li>Intellection</li>
          <li>Arranger</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I see myself in each of these results. When I was younger, I was far
        more extroverted and sociable – comfortably chatting to anybody with
        ears and loving every second, in a blissful state of ignorance. As I’ve
        aged, I’ve become more self conscious, for the better and worse. I’m far
        more thoughtful than ever before, and negotiate several anxieties as a
        product of that introspection. This, too, stems from my ambition as I
        strive to become the best person I can be – as I can see all my
        shortcomings in excruciating detail…</p>

        <p>One realisation that has brought me considerable comfort and tremendous
        agency is that I am simultaneously the victim *and* master of my life,
        meaning I am both the one that sets the learning curve of my life *and*
        the one that must climb that slope. In that, if I find myself
        overwhelmed, I simply level out the learning curve until I have caught
        my breath and find myself willing to give it another go. Maintaining
        this balance has become the delicate dance of my life.</p>

      <h3>Resolving Tension</h3>
      <article>
        <p>I’m not sure how relevant this example will turn out to be but, in 2019,
        I began working for a restaurant in Rotorua. This was the first time
        that I worked full-time (as opposed to studying at school and
        university), and thus the first time I was receiving a full-time salary,
        each week!</p>

        <p>With my first payslip, I bought a brand new pair of Nike Airforce 1
        high-tops off’ve the official Nike website – and wore them to work the
        next day, beaming from ear-to-ear! Everyone was complimenting them,
        which caught the attention of the Head Chef, so he asked to take a look
        at ‘em and strolled around the corner, from the kitchen to the bar area…</p>

        <p>I put my right foot out to show him and, before I even had a chance to
        look up at his reaction, he stamped on my shoe with his greasy boot –
        leaving a permanent print on mine!</p>
        
        <p>I was enraged. I called the owners of the establishment, our bosses, for
        them to step in to rectify the situation; for them to bring justice with
        their authority by condemning his actions and compelling him to replace
        the damage goods… but, as Head Chef, he was far more vital to their
        operation than I was, so they weren’t willing to “die on this hill” as I
        wanted them to.</p>

        <p>This was a while ago, so I can’t remember what course of action was
        taken, but I believe I was offered a half-hearted apology and a pat on
        the back. Needless to say, this didn’t soothe my gripe, though I can
        understand why the owners were unwilling to side with me: the restaurant
        was newly established and they were not as invested in the situation as
        I was; plus, I did somewhat bring the situation upon myself by wearing
        them into a greasy environment.</p>
        
        <p>In that, I suppose this experience did
        effectively teach me a lot about the real world, and what to expect from
        it. For the most part, folks are incredibly friendly and cooperative,
        but I will encounter folks that don’t have my best interests in mind
        and, since the world doesn’t revolve around me, I ought to proactively
        mitigate these sorts of situations from arising.</p>
